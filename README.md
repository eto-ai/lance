# Lance: A Columnar Data Format for Deep Learning Dataset

![CI](https://github.com/eto-ai/lance/actions/workflows/cpp.yml/badge.svg)

Lance is a *cloud-native columnar data format* designed for unstructured machine learning datasets, featuring:

* Fast columnar scan for ML dataset analysis, ML training, and evaluation.
* Encodings that are capable of fast point queries for interactive data exploration.
* Extensible design for index and predicates pushdown.
* Self-describable, nested, and strong-typed data with an extensible type system. Support Image, Video, Audio and Sensor
  Data. Support Annotations and Tensors.
* Schema evolution and update (TODO).
* Cloud-native optimizations on low-cost cloud storage, i.e., AWS S3, Google GCS, or Azure Blob Storage.
* Open access via first-class [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/) integration and multi-language support.

## How to Use Lance

Thanks for its Apache Arrow-first APIs, `lance` can be used as a native `Arrow` extension.
For example, it enables users to directly use `DuckDB` to analyze lance dataset
via [DuckDB's Arrow integration](https://duckdb.org/docs/guides/python/sql_on_arrow).

```python
# pip install pylance duckdb 
import lance
import duckdb

# Understand Label distribution of Oxford Pet Dataset
ds = lance.dataset("s3://eto-public/datasets/oxford_pet/pet.lance")
duckdb.query('select label, count(1) from ds group by label').to_arrow_table()
```

## Why

Machine Learning development cycle involves the steps:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Collection] --> B[Exploration];
    B --> C[Analytics];
    C --> D[Feature Engineer];
    D --> E[Training];
    E --> F[Evaluation];
    F --> C;
    E --> G[Deployment];
    G --> H[Monitoring];
    H --> A;
```

People use different data representations to varying stages for the performance or limited by the tooling available.
The academia mainly uses XML / JSON for annotations and zipped images/sensors data for deep learning, which
is difficult to integrated into data infrastructure and slow to train over cloud storage.
While the industry uses data lake (Parquet-based techniques, i.e., Delta Lake, Iceberg) or data warehouse (AWS Redshift
or Google BigQuery) to collect and analyze data, they have to convert the data into training-friendly formats, such
as [Rikai](https://github.com/eto-ai/rikai)/[Petastorm](https://github.com/uber/petastorm)
or [Tfrecord](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/load_data/tfrecord).
Multiple single-purpose data transforms, as well as syncing copies between cloud storage to local training
instances have become a common practice among ML practices.

While each of the existing data formats excel at its original designed workload, we need a new data format
to tailored for multistage ML development cycle to reduce the fraction in tools and data silos.
